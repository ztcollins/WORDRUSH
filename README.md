# WORDRUSH
Word Rush is a typing game created in P5JS.

This game queries a random word API I found online to get an array of random words that the user must type.

This game is about typing the randomly chosen word before the time runs out. The player earns score for each word typed out before the bar fills up. As the player's score increases, the bar will fill up faster. This continues until it is virtually impossible to type the word.
